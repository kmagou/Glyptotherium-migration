# Evaluating migration hypotheses for the extinct *Glyptotherium* using Ecological Niche Modeling

## Overview
This project uses Ecological Niche Modeling to test the extent of suitable conditions for *Glyptotherium* in Central America and surrounding regions during the intervals when the taxa is thought to have dispersed during the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI). This repository contains the code for the corresponding Magoulick et al. (2024) publication in *Ecography*.

## Content and Workflow
The code should be run sequentially according to the number in the file name. Files in [/Figures](/Figures) are for creating the visualizations and files in [/MESS_analyses](/MESS_analyses) correspond to the data in Supplementary File 2.
